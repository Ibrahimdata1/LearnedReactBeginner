He approached us during the Hajj pilgrimage and he was among the people of virtue and religion. He complained of the people among him in that land under the Tartar government, of the prevalence of ignorance and oppression, the loss of religion and knowledge. He asked me to write a creed for him that he and his household could rely upon. I abstained from that and I said, ‘People have written a number of credal texts, so take one of the creeds written by the Imams of the Sunnah.’ He persisted in asking and he said, ‘I would like no one but you to write it.’ So I wrote this creed for him while I was sitting after midday, and many copies of it have been distributed in Egypt, Iraq, and elsewhere.',
